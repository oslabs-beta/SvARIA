CREATING COMPONENTS FOR SVARIA LIBRARY

1. Solidify core functionality and support for styling, in TypeScript
2. ARIA-fy and test for contrast/screen reader compatibility
3. Under ComponentDemos, create {ComponentName}Tabs folder with {ComponentName}Sandbox and {ComponentName}Docs files
4. Write docs to support usage
5. Navigate to https://svelte.dev/repl/, paste in your code for your component in one tab, and create an example of said
component in another tab. Click save. Copy URL. Please note, for this step you will need to remove TS types, ARIA functions,
and unnecessary imports from the version of your code on the sandbox. To enable tailwind, use the codeblock below in the
script section of your example code.
6. In {ComponentName}Sandbox file, use Sandbox component from SplashPageLib with URL from step 5 as "source" prop.

UPDATING COMPONENTS FOR SVARIA LIBRARY

1. Test new functionality using /testPage. Check devTools for errors and ARIA failures. Test for screen reader compatibility
2. If the component's core features were changed (especially props), ensure that any use of the updated component in the
SvARIA splash page is updated for full functionality.
3. Update the code in the REPL Sandbox, using the instructions in step 5 of CREATING COMPONENTS
4. Update the Docs to reflect any changes that the developer will need to be aware of

TAILWIND SCRIPT:
	if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
		const link = document.createElement('link');
		link.rel = 'stylesheet';
		link.href = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css';
		document.head.appendChild(link);
	}
