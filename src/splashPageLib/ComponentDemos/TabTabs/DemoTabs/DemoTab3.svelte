<p>The aria-selected attribute indicates the current "selected" state for gridcell, option, row and tab roles. This attribute is used to indicate which elements within single-selection and multiple-selection composite widgets are selected. If more than one element is selectable at a time, include aria-multiselectable="true" on the grid, listbox, tablist, or other owning role, while including aria-selected only on the selectable cells, options, and tabs.</p>
